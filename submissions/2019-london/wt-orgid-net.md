## Description

wt-orgid-net is a .NET wrapper for interfacing with the 0xORG smart contract interfaces in the Ethereum blockchain. It provides an easy-to-use interface for a large set of the functions described at https://debugging-tools.windingtree.com/contract-caller.

The repo consists of 2 parts:
- A .net core 3.0 library 
- A sample .net core 3.0 console app that demos the library. It features easy onboarding of an organization, adding an organization to a segment directory, and updating the JSON for an organization.

Getting it up and running:

$ git clone https://github.com/pavloss/wt-orgid-net.git
$ cd wt-orgid-net/WindingTreeOrganizationConsoleTest/
$ dotnet run

Enter your (infura) endpoint url, your private and public key, and get started with the onboarding proces.

Please make a choice
1. Add a new organization
2. Add an existing organization to a segment directory
3. Update the ORG.Json for an existing organization
9. Exit



## Problems
Starting with blockchain and windingtree can be very challenging due to the complicated terminology and interfaces. The aim was to give new developers a good starting point to build on.

## Solution
By creating a wrapper library, we are taking away the complicated work of calculating hashes, learning about ABI's and how the smart contracts are programmed. Even the onboarding tutorial at https://developers.windingtree.com/onboarding/onboarding.html is already quite a challenge to get through. 
By hosting your own JSON and running the example app (option 1), companies/developers will be able to quickly get up and running.


## We learned
A lot about blockchains ;) Since this was our first time interacting with Ethereum, we ran into all the problems that every new developer would run in to. We hope this project makes other peoples lives a lot easier.
